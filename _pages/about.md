Hello! My name is Brandon Tam and I am a first year PhD student in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/graduate-students/brandon-tam) at the University of Toronto. I am also a member of the [University of Toronto Actuarial Science Research Group](https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/). My research interests are in actuarial science and risk management. Prior to starting my PhD, I completed an HBSc at the University of Toronto, specializing in actuarial science and minoring in mathematics. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, playing piano and watching Cantonese dramas.

This website is a little empty right now, but I will be adding to it as I progress through my PhD.
